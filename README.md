# Assignment 1: Living Wallpaper
 
As mentioned in the initial sketch, I am a big fan of the classic "Batman: The Animated Series" from the 1990s. The striking art style featured heavily as the skyline of Gotham, known as "Dark Deco", has been the muse for this project.

I challenged myself to do 2 things in this project. Firstly, I want to create some sort of 3D looking work as most of my past coding projects have been 2D based. Also, I do not wish to use any graphical software for any of assets other than the initial sketch animation.

There was a couple of challenges along the way. It took me quite a while to figure out how to somewhat procedurally draw a building and it did involve my old nemesis Mathematics. Tom and Hazel helped me a lot with the coding with regards to the animation of the windows. I wanted to add gradient to individual building but it is really difficult and slows down the browser a lot as the animation of the window is already rather demanding on the computer memories for some reason.

The end result is still rather satisfactory for me and I think it worked quite well as a background as it is not distracting.
